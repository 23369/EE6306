Figure 4

Implement the same logic function in Pass Transistor Logic (PTL) and in Pseudo
nMOS Complex logic transistor level circuit with minimum number of transistors.
Briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of PTL logic circuit compared
to Pseudo nMOS logic circuit.

(b)

A pipelined design can generally increase the throughput considerably. The
propagation delays of the 4 combinational logic blocks in a datapath are 27ns, 36ns,
28ns and 15ns, respectively, assuming that the delay associated with the latches and
flip-flops are negligible and ignoring clock skew. Determine the data throughput
improvement and the pipeline clock frequency when the 4-stage pipelined design
is implemented. Suggest a method to increase the pipeline clock frequency and
discuss the additional overhead(s) incurred in the new design. State any assumption
made.

INSTRUCTIONS
1.

This paper contains 5 questions and comprises 5 pages.

2.

Answer all 5 questions.

3.

All questions carry equal marks.

4.

This is a closed book examination.

5.

Unless specifically stated, all symbols have their usual meanings.

1.

(a)

An NMOS

transistor is fabricated using the 0.25-um CMOS

technology. The

process uses a doping level of Nz = 8x10!° cm?, B= 350 wA/V’,

W = 6A, andL

= 2. The transistor has a nominal threshold voltage of 0.7 V, and its body is tied

to the source. Assume that éx = 3.9&, és; = 11.7&, & = 8.85104 F/cm, thermal

voltage Vr = 26 mV and n; = 1.6x10!° cm”.

(1)

The SiO2 gate oxide of the NMOS transistor is 3-nm thick. When SiO? is
replaced by a high-k material of the same thickness, the gate capacitance
tripled. Calculate the dielectric constant of the high-k material and explain
the purpose of using a high-k dielectric gate material.

(b)

Ifa potential difference exists between the source and body of the NMOS transistor,

such that V;, > 0, what will happen to the threshold voltage? How will the threshold
voltage vary if the doping level in the transistor is also reduced?

EE6306
The power dissipation in a digital CMOS circuit can typically be categorized
into two main components, static power and dynamic power. List the various
contributing factors for static and dynamic power dissipation.
Unnecessary glitches can be reduced to lower switching activity. Using a
chain of five 2-input NAND gates, where one input of all five gates undergoes
a logic 0-to-1 transition and the other input of the first gate is tied to 5V, show
how glitches can occur with appropriate waveforms.
(10 Marks)

(b)

(i)

Sequential circuits typically incorporate latches or registers in the design.
Draw a static multiplexer-based D-latch and a dynamic multiplexer-based
D-latch with MOS transistors, logic NOT gates and any other necessary
components.

(ii)

In general, the C*MOS latch can be re-designed using a single-phase clock
into a True Single-Phase Clock (TSPC) latch. Sketch your design of a TSPC
latch and briefly describe the circuit operation.
(10 Marks)

(a)

In architecture synthesis of VLSI systems, one of the main tasks is data path
allocation. Briefly explain data path allocation. State and explain the major subtasks in data path allocation.
(10 Marks)

(b)

Testing is one of the important processes in the manufacture of digital integrated
circuits. One of the algorithms used to generate test patterns is the D algorithm. Use
the D algorithm to derive a test vector for the inputs (a, b, c, d, e) of the logic circuit
in Figure 3 to detect a stuck-at-0 (SAO) fault at the point X. Determine the values
at the nodes X, Y, P and Q for this test vector. What is the value at the output f, and

what does the output value indicate?

The dot diagram representing the partial products of a 4-bit by 4-bit binary multiplication
is shown in Figure 4. Carry-save technique is often used to reduce the carry propagation
delay in the summation of partial products. Wallace adder tree and Dadda adder tree use
the carry-save technique.

Explain the concept of carry-save technique and how the carry propagation delay is
reduced.

(b)

Using the usual notation, draw a Wallace adder tree for the summation of the partial
products in the dot diagram in Figure 4 with clear indications of the stages. State
how many full adders and half adders are used in each stage.

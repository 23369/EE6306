The threshold voltage is a function of its length, width and drain voltage in a
small dimension MOSFET. Briefly explain two of the effects that contribute to
such threshold variation.

(4 Marks)

To lower the RC time delay of an interconnect network, both high conductivity
wiring and low-dielectric constant insulators are required, and copper (Cu) is the
apparent choice for a new interconnection metallization. With one or two sentences,
describe the processes used for depositing Cu, and state the drawbacks for using Cu
as an alternative material to aluminium (Al) in VLSI circuits.
(S Marks)

(b)

Given, the resistivity of Al is 2.65 uQ-cm, and the resistivity of Cu is 1.7 uQ-cm.
If Al is replaced with Cu wire and instead of using SiO2 (with k = 3.9), a low-k
dielectric (with k = 2.68) is used, what is the percentage of RC time constant
reduction to be achieved?
(S Marks)

(Cc)

Briefly describe the Bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) technology and states the key
advantages and disadvantages of BiCMOS circuits as compared to CMOS static
logic circuits.
(S Marks)

(d)

Figure 2 shows a BiCMOS NAND gate. Verify if the circuit is truly performing
the NAND function by briefly describing its circuit operation during output high
State and during output low state. When analysing the circuit operation, consider
first the MOSFETs, and take note that the BJTs, Q; and Qo, function as an output
buffer. State if the circuit provides full rail-to-rail swing.
